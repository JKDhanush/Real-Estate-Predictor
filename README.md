# Bangalore Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, India. The model is designed to provide valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and investors in the Bangalore property market. It was inspired by the Codebasics YouTube tutorial on real estate price prediction.

## Key Features

*   **Price Prediction:** Accurate estimation of property prices based on various features.
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Identification of key factors influencing property values in Bangalore.
*   **Machine Learning Implementation:** Utilizes Python and popular machine learning libraries for model building and optimization.
*   **Potential Web Application:** A user-friendly web interface is planned for easy access and interaction with the model.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   pandas
*   scikit-learn (sklearn)
*   [Other libraries you used, e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn]

## Data

The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 real estate listings for properties in Bangalore. The dataset was obtained from [Specify data source, e.g., Kaggle, a web scraping project, etc.].

*   **Data Size:** 10,000+ entries
*   **Key Features:** square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (ETL)

Extensive data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering were performed using ETL processes to ensure data quality and suitability for model training. Key steps included:

*   Handling missing values
*   Removing outliers
*   Feature scaling and normalization

## Model Development

The model was built using Linear Regression, Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

*   **Algorithms Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest and SVM
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV
*   **Key Performance Metric:** R-squared = [0.82]

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as R-squared.

## Web Application (Planned)

The next step is to develop a user-friendly web application that will allow users to input property details and receive price predictions from the trained model.
